# Example Styleguide

This application is an example of a living styleguide, generated from KSS documented styles.

Run it with:

    npm install .
	node app.js
	open http://localhost:3000

This example is a standalone example, and an excellent place to start your styleguide. To start working with jss, follow these simple steps:

1. Copy this folder to a new location
2. Name it something else
3. Edit index.html, layout.html, and layout.css to represent your purposes better.
4. Add your own stylesheets in with styleguide comment blocks
5. Edit styleguide.html and possibly layout.html to provide navigation and markup for your styles.
6. Bask in the glory of your maintainable living styleguide
